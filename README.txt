Artificial Intelligence "Chatbot" program written in Python (using PyTorch) that aims to learn and imitate human speech. Users can interact with the AI and get quick text and audio responses. The AI implements recurrent neural networks to learn both speech patterns and vocabulary through analyzing selected databases of human conversations as well as generate appropriate responses to user input.

main.py       : Python module used to run and interact with the system

Processing.py : Python module containing functions to load and preprocess datasets

Classes.py    : Python module containing object classes with implementations for the RNNs

Training.py   : Python module containing functions to be used when training new models or loading pretrained models
